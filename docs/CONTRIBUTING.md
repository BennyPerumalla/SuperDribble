# 🤝 Contributing to Super-Dribble

Welcome to **Super-Dribble**! 🎧  
We're building a powerful, privacy-respecting, real-time audio enhancement extension for browsers. We welcome contributions—bug fixes, new features, and ideas. But to keep things organized and inclusive, please follow these guidelines.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute:

* **Reporting Issues:** If you find a bug or encounter unexpected behavior, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. Provide detailed steps to reproduce the problem, your operating system, VLC version, and any relevant logs.
* **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? Open an issue and describe your suggestion clearly. Explain the use case and potential benefits.
* **Submitting Pull Requests:** If you want to contribute code (bug fixes, new features, improvements):
    1.  Fork the repository.
    2.  Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-number`).
    3.  Make your changes, adhering to the coding standards.
    4.  Add tests for your changes if applicable.
    5.  Ensure your code compiles and integrates correctly with VLC.
    6.  Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
    7.  Push your branch to your fork.
    8.  Open a pull request against the main repository's `main` (or `develop`) branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes in the pull request.


## 📦 Code Contribution Guidelines

### ✅ 1. One Feature or Bugfix per Commit

- **Each pull request must have a single logical purpose.**
- **Do not combine multiple bug fixes, features, or refactors in a single PR.**

### ✅ 2. No Functional Changes During Refactoring

- **Refactoring is welcome, but it should not change how features work.**
- **No new features, UI tweaks, or behavior modifications inside refactor PRs.**
- **Refactor commits should be labeled clearly:**

## 🧠 Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repo and create a new branch from `main`.
2. Keep code **modular, readable, and well-commented**.
3. Write clear **commit messages** using:

 - `Fix:` – Bug fixes
 - `Feat:` – New features
 - `Refactor:` – Non-functional code improvements
 - `Docs:` – Documentation updates
4. Run tests (if any) and validate popup/UI in `chrome://extensions`.

## 📎 Code Style

- **Use consistent indentation:**  
- 2 spaces for JavaScript
- 4 spaces for C++
- **Use descriptive variable and function names.**
- **Keep logic modular and reusable.**
- **For UI, prefer Tailwind, utility classes, or scoped custom styles.**
