# Installation Guide - Super Dribble Audio Amplifier

## Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser (version 88 or later)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BennyPerumalla/Super-dribble.git
cd Super-dribble
```

### 2. Build the UI

The extension uses a React-based UI that needs to be built before loading:

```bash
cd UI
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

This creates the `UI/build/` directory with the compiled UI files.

6. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### 4. Verify Installation

1. Look for the "Super Dribble Audio Amplifier" extension in your extensions list
2. The extension icon should appear in your Chrome toolbar
3. If the icon is not visible, click the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar and pin the extension

## First Use

### 2. Adjust Audio Settings

- **Volume**: Use the volume slider to adjust overall volume

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load

**Problem**: The extension doesn't appear in Chrome's extension list.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure all files are present in the project directory
2. Verify that `UI/build/` directory exists and contains files
3. Check that `manifest.json` is in the root directory
4. Try reloading the extension in `chrome://extensions/`

### Audio Not Working

**Problem**: The extension loads but doesn't affect audio.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure the webpage has active audio content
2. Check that the extension has permission to capture tab audio
3. Look for error messages in the browser console (F12 â†’ Console)
4. Try refreshing the webpage and restarting audio

### Build Errors

**Problem**: `npm run build` fails with errors.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure Node.js version 16+ is installed
2. Delete `node_modules/` and run `npm install` again
3. Check that all dependencies are properly installed
4. Verify TypeScript compilation errors are resolved

### Permission Issues

**Problem**: Chrome asks for additional permissions.

**Solutions**:
1. The extension needs `activeTab` and `tabCapture` permissions
2. These are standard permissions for audio processing extensions
3. Grant the permissions when prompted
